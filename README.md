# Video-Speech-convertion-to-Text-
In the real world, where the biggest workplace issues are resolved, the necessity for a video and
audio to text converter exists. This converter can be used for documentation reasons by a wide range
of software firms, educational institutions, and other organizations. This is mostly used by software
businesses to access notes, project details, project presentation materials, etc. We choose Google
Speech Recognition for our system due to its superior accuracy and user-friendly interface. Python
was even chosen by us for its ease of learning. When there is only one audio file in the system, the
audio to text converter should be used to make it simple for the user to convert the audio to text.
Speech recognition which is an inter disciplinary field of computational linguistics aids in developing
technologies that empowers the recognition and translation of speech into text. Text summarization
extracts the utmost important information from a source which is a text and provides the adequate
summary of the same. The research work presented in this paper describes an easy and effective
method for speech recognition. The speech is converted to the corresponding text and produces
summarized text. This has various applications like lecture notes creation, summarizing catalogues
for lengthy documents and so on. Extensive experimentation is performed to validate the efficiency
of the proposed method

Speech recognition is the process of making a machine recognize the speech of diffrent people based
on certain words or phrases. Variations in the pronunciation are quite evident in each individualâ€™s
speech. The original form of the speech is a signal, and a signal is processed such that all the
information present in the signal is converted in to the text format. The feature extraction is the
process of taking a signal and converting it to the required format with certain logic. Even though
speech is the easiest way of communication, there exist some problems with speech recognition like
the fluency, pronunciation, broken words, stuttering issues etc. All these have to be addressed while
processing a speech. Text summarization is one of the major concepts used in the field of
documentation. Lengthy documents are difficult to read and understand as it consumes lot of time.
Text summarisation solves this problem by providing a shortened summary of it with semantics. In
the proposed work a combination of speech to text conversion and text summarisation is
implemented. This hybrid method will aid applications that require brief summary of lengthy
speeches which is quite useful for documentation. The flow diagram of the proposed approach is
mentioned in Figure 1, in which the speech recognition and text summarization is given as two
different modules. The combination of these two modules aids any application in which
summarization is required. The first and foremost step to work with NLP (Natural Language
Processing) is to extract the features from the speech which has some values. If a word or a sentence
is recognized as meaningless, then it becomes an obstacle to summarization process.
